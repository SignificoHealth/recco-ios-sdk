To integrate using Apple's Swift package manager, without Xcode integration, add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/recco/recco-ios-sdk.git")
```

and then specify `"Recco"` as a dependency of the Target in which you wish to use Recco.
Here's an example `PackageDescription`:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.3
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyPackage",
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "MyPackage",
            targets: ["MyPackage"]
        ),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(
            url: "https://github.com/recco/recco-ios-sdk.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.8"))
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "MyPackage"
        )
    ]
)
```
